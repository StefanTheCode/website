### New "extension" keyword in .NET 10
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
##### With .NET 10 extension feature now you can define **extension block**s for any type. It is shaping up to be one of the most exciting updates in recent years - and one of the most underrated gems is the new extension keyword introduced in C# 14 (Preview 3). 
&nbsp;  

##### If you thought extension methods were powerful before, this takes things to a whole new level.
&nbsp;  

##### In this article, Iâ€™ll break down:
##### â€¢ What the new extension feature does
##### â€¢ Why it matters
##### â€¢ Real-world use cases you couldnâ€™t solve cleanly before
##### â€¢ And how it changes the way we organize logic around existing types

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
###  Wait, whatâ€™s wrong with Extension Methods?
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
##### With the new syntax, you can define extension blocks for any type. 
##### These blocks allow:
&nbsp;  

##### â€¢ Extension **properties**
##### â€¢ Private **backing fields** inside the extension scope
##### â€¢ Grouped logic in a clean and local context
##### â€¢ Even **static extension blocks** for related helpers
&nbsp;  

##### Syntax:

```csharp

public static class MyExtensions
{
    extension(TargetType instance)
    {
        public ReturnType PropertyOrMethod => ...;
    }

    extension static
    {
        public static ReturnType StaticHelper() => ...;
    }
}
```

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Real-World Use Case: Multi-Tenant SaaS and HttpContext
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### Letâ€™s say youâ€™re building a multi-tenant SaaS product. You need to:
&nbsp;  

##### â€¢ Extract the TenantId from claims
##### â€¢ Parse and validate the UserId
##### â€¢ Check if the user is a tenant admin
##### â€¢ Read custom headers
##### â€¢ Expose defaults and validation logic
&nbsp;  

##### The old way? Youâ€™d create scattered static methods.
##### The new way? One structured block with everything grouped and cached.

```csharp

public static class MultiTenantHttpContextExtensions
{
    extension(HttpContext ctx)
    {
        private string? _tenantId;
        private Guid? _userId;

        public string TenantId =>
            _tenantId ??=
                ctx.User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(c => c.Type == "tenant_id")?.Value
                ?? throw new UnauthorizedAccessException("Tenant ID missing");

        public Guid UserId =>
            _userId ??=
                Guid.TryParse(
                    ctx.User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(c => c.Type == "user_id")?.Value, out var id)
                ? id
                : throw new UnauthorizedAccessException("User ID invalid");

        public bool IsTenantAdmin =>
            ctx.User.IsInRole("Admin") || ctx.Request.Headers["X-Tenant-Admin"] == "true";

        public string? GetHeader(string name) =>
            ctx.Request.Headers.TryGetValue(name, out var value)
                ? value.ToString()
                : null;
    }

    extension static
    {
        public static string DefaultTenantId => "public";

        public static bool IsValidTenantId(string? id) =>
            !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(id) && id.All(char.IsLetterOrDigit);
    }
}
```

##### This approach brings:
##### â€¢ Readable, organized logic
##### â€¢ Lazy caching via private fields (_tenantId, _userId)
##### â€¢ Cohesive domain logic scoped to the right context


&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Another Example: Extending External Models
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### Letâ€™s say youâ€™re working with a third-party DTO:

```csharp

public class OrderDto
{
    public List<OrderItemDto> Items { get; set; }
    public string Status { get; set; }
}
```
&nbsp;  
##### With new extensions, you can wrap domain logic around it without modifying the class:
```csharp

public static class OrderExtensions
{
    extension(OrderDto order)
    {
        public decimal TotalAmount =>
            order.Items.Sum(i => i.Quantity * i.PricePerUnit);

        public bool IsComplete =>
            order.Status == "Completed";

        public int TotalItems =>
            order.Items.Sum(i => i.Quantity);
    }
}
```
##### Usage becomes clean and expressive:
&nbsp;  

```csharp

if (order.TotalAmount > 1000 && order.IsComplete)
{
    // Do something
}
```
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Why not just use methods from .NET 10?

##### This isn't just a cosmetic change - it's a paradigm shift in how we organize logic.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### My Gotchas & Notes
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### â€¢ This is currently available in **.NET 10 Preview 3** with C# 14
##### â€¢ Still being refined, so expect updates in syntax and tooling support
##### â€¢ All your existing extension methods continue to work - this is purely additive
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### My Advice
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### Use this **when youâ€™re extending a type with multiple behaviors** that feel like they belong together:
&nbsp;  

##### â€¢ DTO transformations
##### â€¢ HTTP context and claims logic
##### â€¢ Computed values on external models
##### â€¢ Domain-specific enhancements (e.g., IsActive, TotalAmount, NeedsSync, etc.)
&nbsp;  

##### It keeps your logic close, clean, and cache-friendly - and once you start using it, you wonâ€™t want to go back.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Wrapping Up
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### The new extension keyword isnâ€™t flashy at first glance. But it solves a real pain point for developers who care about clean architecture, rich domain modeling, and maintainable code.

##### It gives us the power we didnâ€™t even know we were missing in C# - and itâ€™s just the beginning of a new era of expressiveness.
&nbsp;  

##### Let me know if you'd like to see how I plan to use this in:
&nbsp;  

##### â€¢ CQRS helpers
##### â€¢ ViewModel builders
##### â€¢ ASP.NET Core service pipelines
&nbsp;  
##### Because I already note what I can refactor for some of my older projects.
&nbsp;  

##### That's all from me today.
