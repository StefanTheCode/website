### Background
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
##### Hey friends! ðŸ‘‹
&nbsp;  

##### In todayâ€™s cloud-connected world, weâ€™re constantly making HTTP calls to external APIs, microservices, or third-party integrations. But letâ€™s face it: networks can be flaky, services can slow down, and stuff just... breaks.
&nbsp;  

##### What if your app could handle those hiccups **gracefully** without crashing or stressing out your users?
&nbsp;  

##### Great news! .NET 8 and 9 introduced a **first-party library** for building resilient apps: Microsoft.Extensions.Resilience. 
&nbsp;  

##### Think of it like Polly, but built into .NET, fully supported by Microsoft, and super easy to plug into your existing setup.
&nbsp;  

##### Letâ€™s break it all down in a **friendly, real-world way** - with full code, strategy-by-strategy explanations, and Minimal API examples.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### What is Microsoft.Extensions.Resilience?
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
##### It's a set of libraries that help you:
&nbsp;  
##### â€¢ Retry failed operations
##### â€¢ Set timeouts
##### â€¢ Break circuits on repeated failures
##### â€¢ Control request rates
##### â€¢ Send backup (hedged) requests
&nbsp;  
##### All of these are called **resilience strategies**, and you can mix and match them using a composable pipeline.
&nbsp;  
##### You get full integration with HttpClientFactory, DI, logging, and even OpenTelemetry.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Project Setup
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### Add required packages:

```csharp

dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Resilience
```

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Resilience Pipelines
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### To apply resilience, you need to build a pipeline made up of different resilience strategies. These strategies run in the exact order you define them -so the order really matters.
&nbsp;  
##### You begin by creating a **ResiliencePipelineBuilder**, which 

```csharp

ResiliencePipeline pipeline = new()
    .AddRetry(new RetryStrategyOptions
    {
        ShouldHandle = new PredicateBuilder().Handle<ConflictException>(),
        Delay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2),
        MaxRetryAttempts = 3,
        BackoffType = DelayBackoffType.Exponential,
        UseJitter = true
    })
    .AddTimeout(new TimeoutStrategyOptions
    {
        Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5)
    })
    .Build();

await pipeline.ExecuteAsync(
    async ct => await httpClient.GetAsync("/api/weather", ct),
    cancellationToken);
```
&nbsp;  

##### Now letâ€™s break down each strategy...

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Retry Strategy
&nbsp;  

##### <center> *"Try again if it fails... but not forever."* </center>
&nbsp;  
##### A retry strategy lets you retry an operation that failed due to transient issues (like a timeout or HTTP 500).
&nbsp;  

##### Why?
##### â€¢ Temporary failures are common in distributed systems.
##### â€¢ Retry gives the system time to recover.
&nbsp;  
##### Example:
```csharp

builder.Services.AddResiliencePipeline("retry-pipeline", builder =>
{
    builder.AddRetry(new RetryStrategyOptions
    {
        MaxRetryAttempts = 3,
        Delay = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(300),
        BackoffType = DelayBackoffType.Exponential,
        ShouldHandle = new PredicateBuilder().Handle<HttpRequestException>()
    });
});
```
&nbsp;  
##### This retries 3 times, with exponentially increasing delay: 300ms, 600ms, 1200ms...

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Timeout Strategy
&nbsp;  

##### <center> *"Donâ€™t hang forever. Bail out if itâ€™s too slow."* </center>
&nbsp;  
##### The timeout strategy sets a max duration for how long an operation can run. If itâ€™s too slow - itâ€™s out.
&nbsp;  

##### Why?
##### â€¢ You donâ€™t want threads hanging forever.
##### â€¢ Itâ€™s better to fail fast and free resources.
&nbsp;  
##### Example:
```csharp

builder.Services.AddResiliencePipeline("timeout-pipeline", builder =>
{
    builder.AddTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));
});
```
&nbsp;  
##### If your external service doesnâ€™t respond in 2 seconds, it fails and triggers the next strategy (like retry)...

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Circuit Breaker Strategy
&nbsp;  

##### <center> *"If something keeps failing, stop trying for a while."* </center>
&nbsp;  
##### The circuit breaker temporarily blocks calls to a failing system, preventing overload and giving it time to recover.
&nbsp;  

##### Why?
##### â€¢ Avoid hammering a broken service.
##### â€¢ Let things cool off.
&nbsp;  
##### Example:
```csharp

builder.Services.AddResiliencePipeline("cb-pipeline", builder =>
{
    builder.AddCircuitBreaker(new CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions
    {
        FailureRatio = 0.5,
        MinimumThroughput = 10,
        SamplingDuration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30),
        BreakDuration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(15)
    });
});
```
&nbsp;  
##### If 2 out of 4 calls fail within 10 seconds, the breaker "trips" and all further calls fail fast for 20 seconds.


&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Hedging Strategy
&nbsp;  

##### <center> *"If you're not getting a reply, ask someone else too - just in case."* </center>
&nbsp;  
##### The hedging strategy sends secondary requests after a delay if the primary one is too slow or might fail. Itâ€™s like having a plan B running in parallel.
&nbsp;  

##### Why?
##### â€¢ Reduce latency spikes.
##### â€¢ Improve success rate by racing multiple attempts.
&nbsp;  
##### Example:
```csharp

builder.Services.AddResiliencePipeline<string, string>("gh-hedging", builder =>
{
    builder.AddHedging(new HedgingStrategyOptions<string>
    {
        MaxHedgedAttempts = 3,
        DelayGenerator = args =>
        {
            var delay = args.AttemptNumber switch
            {
                0 or 1 => TimeSpan.Zero, // Parallel mode
                _ => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(-1) // Fallback mode
            };

            return new ValueTask<TimeSpan>(delay);
        }
    });
});
```
&nbsp;  
##### With this configuration, the hedging strategy:
##### - Initiates a maximum of 4 executions. This includes initial action and an additional 3 attempts.
##### - Allows the first two executions to proceed in parallel, while the third and fourth executions follow the fallback mode.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Fallback Strategy
&nbsp;  

##### <center> *"If something keeps failing, have a backup plan."* </center>
&nbsp;  
##### The fallback strategy provides an alternative response when a primary operation fails, helping your app stay functional even when things go wrong.
&nbsp;  

##### Why?
##### â€¢ Avoid crashing the user experience.
##### â€¢ Stay graceful under pressure.
&nbsp;  
##### Example:
```csharp

builder.Services.AddResiliencePipeline<string, string?>("gh-fallback", builder =>
{
    builder.AddFallback(new FallbackStrategyOptions<string?>
    {
        FallbackAction = _ =>
            Outcome.FromResultAsValueTask<string?>(string.Empty)
    });
});
```

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Rate Limiting Strategy
&nbsp;  

##### <center> *"Too many requests? Slow down before you burn out."* </center>
&nbsp;  
##### The rate limiter strategy controls how many calls your system can make within a time window - protecting resources and avoiding service throttling.
&nbsp;  

##### Why?
##### â€¢ Prevent overwhelming dependencies.
##### â€¢ Ensure fair usage and system stability.
&nbsp;  
##### Example:
```csharp

builder.Services.AddResiliencePipeline("ratelimiter-pipeline", builder =>
{
    builder.AddRateLimiter(new SlidingWindowRateLimiter(
        new SlidingWindowRateLimiterOptions
        {
            PermitLimit = 100,
            SegmentsPerWindow = 4,
            Window = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)
        }
    ));
});
```

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
###  Using ResiliencePipelineProvider to Apply Resilience Automatically
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### When you're working with resilience in .NET and using **Dependency Injection**, you donâ€™t need to manually build your pipeline every time. 
&nbsp;  

##### Instead, you can ask the ResiliencePipelineProvider to fetch a configured pipeline by its key.
&nbsp;  

##### Here's how it works:
&nbsp;  
##### â€¢ You define your pipeline (e.g., with a fallback or retry strategy)  and register it using a key like "gh-fallback".
##### â€¢ Then, inside your route or handler, you request that pipeline using GetPipeline<T>(), where T is the expected result type.
```csharp

app.MapGet("/subscribers", async (
    HttpClient httpClient,
    ResiliencePipelineProvider<string> pipelineProvider,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken) =>
{
    var pipeline = pipelineProvider.GetPipeline<Subscriber?>("gh-fallback");

    return await pipeline.ExecuteAsync(
        async token =>
            await httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<Subscriber>("api/subscribers", token),
        cancellationToken);
});
```

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Wrapping Up
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### Microsoftâ€™s new Microsoft.Extensions.Resilience stack makes it easier than ever to apply production-grade resilience across your entire .NET application.
&nbsp;  

##### You donâ€™t need to reinvent the wheel with Polly yourself - use the official pipeline abstraction, build named strategies, and compose reusable policies that apply to your internal services or third-party APIs.
&nbsp;  

##### Use retry + timeout + circuit breaker as your minimum standard for every external call. And if you want even more flexibility, customize the heck out of it!
&nbsp;  

##### That's all from me today.
