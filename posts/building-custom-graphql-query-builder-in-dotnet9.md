&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### The Background
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
##### Modern APIs are all about flexibility - and that‚Äôs where GraphQL shines. 
&nbsp;  

##### But when working with strongly typed languages like C#, constructing queries can become repetitive and error-prone. 
&nbsp;  

##### Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if you could build reusable .graphql templates and dynamically inject variables?
&nbsp;  

##### Today, I‚Äôll show you how to create a **GraphQL Query Builder in .NET 9**, wrap it up with **Minimal APIs**, and cleanly integrate it using **dependency injection** and GraphQL.Client.
&nbsp;  
##### Let‚Äôs dive in.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### The Idea
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
##### We‚Äôll:
&nbsp;  
##### ‚Ä¢ Create .graphql query templates with placeholders like $userId.
##### ‚Ä¢ Load and inject values dynamically.
##### ‚Ä¢ Make it reusable using a **GraphQLQueryBuilder**.
##### ‚Ä¢ Use Minimal APIs to expose the functionality.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### üìÅ Directory Structure
&nbsp;  

![GraphQL Directory Structure](/images/blog/posts/building-custom-graphql-query-builder-in-dotnet9/graphql-directory.png)
&nbsp;  
#### ‚Ä¢ Root: /GraphQLBuilderDemo/
&nbsp;  
##### This is your main project directory. It includes all source code and configuration files. The Program.cs file lives here because it's a Minimal API app and doesn‚Äôt use Controllers or Startup classes.
&nbsp;  
#### ‚Ä¢ /Queries/
&nbsp;  
##### Holds raw .graphql files. These are:

##### ‚Ä¢ Static query templates
##### ‚Ä¢ Contain placeholders like $userId or $status
##### ‚Ä¢ Used by the builder to generate final queries with real values
&nbsp;  

##### **Example files:**
##### ‚Ä¢ GetUser.graphql: Gets user details and posts
##### ‚Ä¢ GetOrders.graphql: Fetches orders, customers, line items
&nbsp;  

##### **Benefits:**
##### ‚Ä¢ Keeps queries clean and versionable
##### ‚Ä¢ Easy to tweak without recompiling code
&nbsp;  


#### ‚Ä¢ /GraphQL
&nbsp;  

##### Holds shared GraphQL utility code.
&nbsp;  

##### **GraphQLQueryBuilder.cs**
&nbsp;  

##### Your core utility that:
##### ‚Ä¢ Reads .graphql templates from the /Queries folder
##### ‚Ä¢ Replaces placeholder variables dynamically
##### ‚Ä¢ Returns a GraphQLRequest ready to be executed

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### .graphql files
&nbsp;  

```json

{
  user(id: "$userId") {
    id
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

##### The** Queries/GetUser.graphql file** defines a GraphQL query that retrieves detailed information about a specific user by their Id. 
&nbsp;  

##### It uses a placeholder variable **$userId**, which is dynamically replaced at runtime using the C# GraphQLQueryBuilder. 
&nbsp;  

##### The query requests the user's basic information - id, name, and email - along with a list of their posts, fetching just the title of each post. 
&nbsp;  

##### This structure allows you to request nested and precise data in one call, avoiding over-fetching. 
&nbsp;  

##### By keeping the query in a separate file and using placeholders, you make your code more maintainable, reusable, and clean - especially when working with multiple queries and dynamic input values.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### GraphQLQueryBuilder.cs
&nbsp;  

```csharp

using GraphQL;
using System.Reflection;

namespace GraphQLDemo.GraphQL;

public static class GraphQLQueryBuilder
{
    public static async Task<GraphQLRequest> BuildQuery(string fileName, Dictionary<string, string> variables)
    {
        string path = Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory, "Queries", fileName);
        string query = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(path);

        foreach (var variable in variables)
        {
            query = query.Replace($"{variable.Key}", variable.Value);
        }

        return new GraphQLRequest { Query = query };
    }
}
```

##### The **GraphQLQueryBuilder.cs file** contains a static utility class that simplifies how we build dynamic GraphQL requests in .NET. 
&nbsp;  

##### Instead of hardcoding query strings in C# or manually concatenating values, this builder loads reusable .graphql files from the Queries/ folder and replaces placeholder variables like $userId or $status with real values at runtime. 
&nbsp;  

##### The method BuildQuery takes a file name and a dictionary of variables, reads the query file as text, and performs string replacements for each placeholder. 
&nbsp;  

##### It returns a GraphQLRequest object, ready to be sent using a GraphQL client. 
&nbsp;  

##### This approach keeps your C# code clean, your queries versionable, and makes it easy to work with complex or frequently changing queries without modifying your compiled code.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### UserService.cs
&nbsp;  

```csharp

using GraphQL;
using GraphQL.Client.Abstractions;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace GraphQLDemo.Services;

public class UserService
{
    private readonly IGraphQLClient _client;

    public UserService(IGraphQLClient client)
    {
        _client = client;
    }

    public async Task<string> GetUserWithPostsAsync(string userId)
    {
        var request = await GraphQLQueryBuilder.BuildQuery("GetUser.graphql", new()
        {
            { "userId", userId }
        });

        var response = await _client.SendQueryAsync<dynamic>(request);
        return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(response.Data);
    }
}
```
&nbsp;  

##### The **UserService.cs file** is where the logic for fetching user data from a GraphQL API lives. 
&nbsp;  

##### It acts as a bridge between your Minimal API endpoint and the GraphQL backend. 
&nbsp;  

##### This service takes care of building the GraphQL request using the GraphQLQueryBuilder, injecting the dynamic value for userId, and sending the request using the IGraphQLClient (from the **GraphQL.Client library**). 
&nbsp;  

##### Once the response is received, it serializes the result into JSON so it can be easily returned to the API consumer. 
&nbsp;  

##### By isolating this logic in a service class, you make your code modular, testable, and reusable - allowing you to keep your endpoint code clean and focused only on handling HTTP requests and responses.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Program.cs - DI and Minimal API
&nbsp;  

```csharp

using GraphQL.Client.Http;
using GraphQL.Client.Serializer.Newtonsoft;
using GraphQLDemo.Services;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Register GraphQL client
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IGraphQLClient>(_ =>
    new GraphQLHttpClient("https://your-graphql-endpoint.com/graphql", new NewtonsoftJsonSerializer())
);

// Register your service
builder.Services.AddScoped<UserService>();

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/user/{id}", async (string id, UserService userService) =>
{
    var result = await userService.GetUserWithPostsAsync(id);
    return Results.Json(JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(result));
});

app.Run();
```

##### The Program.cs file is the entry point of your .NET 9 Minimal API application. 
&nbsp;  

##### It sets up the app‚Äôs core components: dependency injection, GraphQL client configuration, and the API endpoints. 
&nbsp;  

##### First, it registers an **IGraphQLClient as a singleton**, configuring it with your GraphQL endpoint and using NewtonsoftJsonSerializer for response handling. 
&nbsp;  

##### Then, it adds your custom services like UserService and OrderService (read next chapter) to the DI container. 
&nbsp;  

##### After that, it defines HTTP routes using app.MapGet, such as** /user/{id}** or **/orders**, which accept parameters from the request, call the appropriate service method, and return the response in JSON format. 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Postman Testing
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### In Postman, instead of creating a basic HTTP request, you need to create GraphQL Request (New -> GraphQL).
&nbsp;  

##### Note: You will need GraphQL Server to test it. You can create your own in .NET - [Learn here how to create it](https://thecodeman.net/posts/get-started-with-grapql-in-dotnet?utm_source=Website). 
&nbsp;  

##### Or, you can use Fake Server online: [GraphQLZero](https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/#example-top).

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Advanced Example: 
### Fetching Orders with Line Items and Customer Info
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### Imagine you're building a dashboard for a commerce platform. You want to retrieve:
&nbsp;  
##### ‚Ä¢ A list of orders
##### ‚Ä¢ Each order's line items (products, quantity, price)
##### ‚Ä¢ The associated customer‚Äôs name and email
##### ‚Ä¢ With filters like status and date range
&nbsp;  

#### Queries/GetOrders.graphql

```csharp

{
  orders(
    filter: {
      status: "$status"
      dateRange: {
        from: "$dateFrom"
        to: "$dateTo"
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
    status
    createdAt
    customer {
      id
      name
      email
    }
    lineItems {
      product {
        id
        name
        price
      }
      quantity
    }
  }
}
```
&nbsp;  

##### What‚Äôs different here?
##### ‚Ä¢ Variables for both simple ($status) and nested values ($dateFrom, $dateTo)
##### ‚Ä¢ Traversing multiple object levels (orders -> lineItems -> product)
##### ‚Ä¢ Shows how to handle filter blocks with multiple parameters
&nbsp;  
#### Updated GraphQLQueryBuilder.cs (same as before)

```csharp

var request = await GraphQLQueryBuilder.BuildQuery("GetOrders.graphql", new()
{
    { "status", "SHIPPED" },
    { "dateFrom", "2024-01-01" },
    { "dateTo", "2024-12-31" }
});
```
&nbsp;  
#### OrderService.cs changes:

```csharp

public async Task<string> GetOrdersAsync(string status, string dateFrom, string dateTo)
{
    var request = await GraphQLQueryBuilder.BuildQuery("GetOrders.graphql", new()
    {
        { "status", status },
        { "dateFrom", dateFrom },
        { "dateTo", dateTo }
    });

    var response = await _client.SendQueryAsync<dynamic>(request);
    return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(response.Data);
}
```
&nbsp;  

#### Adding a new Minimal API endpoint:


```csharp

app.MapGet("/orders", async (
  string status,
  string dateFrom,
  string dateTo,
  OrderService orderService) =>
{
    var result = await orderService.GetOrdersAsync(status, dateFrom, dateTo);
    return Results.Json(JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(result));
});
```

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Wrapping Up
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### By introducing a **custom GraphQL Query Builder in .NET**, we've created a clean, flexible, and maintainable way to manage your GraphQL operations. 
&nbsp;  

##### You've seen how you can separate query definitions from C# logic, dynamically inject values into templates, and keep your services lightweight and testable.
&nbsp;  

##### This pattern works great for teams who want to maintain control over their queries without embedding long strings or deeply coupling to GraphQL libraries. 
&nbsp;  

##### While there are trade-offs (like lack of compile-time validation or limited type safety), the balance of simplicity and maintainability makes it a solid approach for many real-world projects.
&nbsp;  

##### If you're building GraphQL clients in .NET and care about clean architecture, this is a great foundation. And as your needs grow, you can always extend this with support for real GraphQL variables, query caching, fragments, or even code-gen tools.
&nbsp;  

##### That's all from me today.
