### Introduction to API Gateways
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### In the digital era, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) have become the backbone of software development, enabling different systems to communicate and exchange data seamlessly.
&nbsp;  

##### However, as the reliance on APIs grows, so does the complexity of managing and securing them.

&nbsp;  

##### This is where API Gateways come into play, offering a robust solution for developers and organizations looking to expose their backend APIs securely.

&nbsp;  

#### What is an API Gateway?

&nbsp; 
##### An API Gateway acts as a gatekeeper for your APIs, managing requests from clients (such as web or mobile apps) to your backend services.
##### It's a critical component in modern application architectures, offering a single entry point for all API interactions.
##### Beyond simplifying the API landscape, gateways provide essential features like security, rate limiting, and analytics, making them indispensable for API management.

&nbsp; 
##### Today we will talk about the Core functionalities of API Gateway, where I will try to explain things in the simplest possible way.
&nbsp; 
##### As an API Gateway I will take [Zuplo](https://zuplo.com/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=stefan-gateway).
&nbsp; 
##### If you haven't heard of Zuplo - It is an **API Management platform** that is oriented around the API Developer Experience.
&nbsp; 
##### They are trying to build a platform to make it fast (and it's really fast) and straightforward for developers to deliver a "Stripe-level" API experience to their users. 
&nbsp; 
##### This includes handling many portions of Full-lifecycle API management, including documentation, testing, deployments, and monitoring.
&nbsp; 
##### There are many developers out there struggling to build high-quality API experiences quickly, and at a reasonable price - Zuplo can help you.
&nbsp; 
##### And yes, it's **completely free** to start!
&nbsp;

### 3 Core Features of API Gateways
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### API Gateways are packed with features designed to enhance the security and efficiency of your APIs.
&nbsp;  
##### Let's delve into some of the core functionalities that make API Gateways a must-have in your infrastructure.
&nbsp;  
#### Request Routing
&nbsp;  
##### At its core, an API Gateway efficiently routes requests from clients to the appropriate backend service. This feature is crucial in microservices architectures where a single application might be split into dozens of smaller, interconnected services.
&nbsp;  
##### The gateway acts as a ** central point of entry**, ensuring that requests are directed to the correct service based on the request path, method, and other headers.
&nbsp;  
##### This not only simplifies the client-facing API surface but also enables services to be relocated, scaled, or modified without impacting the client.
![Api Gateway Request Routing](/images/blog/posts/api-gateways-the-secure-bridge-for-exposing-your-api/api-gateway-request-routing.png)

&nbsp;  
##### This can be seen directly in Zuplo if you go to the routes.oas.json file that tells how certain routes are routed.
&nbsp;  

##### In the **Route Designer tab**, you can see all the routes available in the API. If we open any route, we will see which is the handler for the specific request.
&nbsp;  

##### Let's say in the example shown below the Get all todos endpoint with the URL *https: //copper-elephant-main-57e0097.d2.zuplo.dev/v1/todos* will be redirected to *https: //jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos*.
&nbsp;  
##### Also, here you can add new routes.
![Zuplo Adding Routes](/images/blog/posts/api-gateways-the-secure-bridge-for-exposing-your-api/zuplo-adding-routes.png)
&nbsp;  
#### Authentication and Authorization
&nbsp;  
##### Security is paramount in API management, and API Gateways excel in providing robust mechanisms for authenticating and authorizing users.
&nbsp;  
##### Authentication **verifies the identity of the user making the request**, often through API keys, OAuth tokens, JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), or other credentials.
&nbsp;  
##### Authorization, on the other hand, **determines whether the authenticated user has permission to perform the requested action**.
&nbsp;  
##### By centralizing these security checks at the gateway level, applications can offload a significant burden of security management, ensuring that only valid, authorized requests reach the backend services. services to be relocated, scaled, or modified without impacting the client.
&nbsp;  
##### API Gateways often include solutions for authenticating your users. Many include ways of managing and issuing API keys to developers, either manually, via API, or self-serve. You then need to manually integrate this system into your docs platform. 
&nbsp;  
##### What I found here is that using separate tools for API authentication, documentation, and analytics is painful.
&nbsp;  
##### Your API users can manage their API keys directly from Zuplo’s autogenerated developer portal, and even view their API usage analytics.
&nbsp;  
##### What I like about Zuplo also, is that it offers robust support for **any type of authentication**. They have a first-class [API Key management](https://zuplo.com/features/api-key-management?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=stefan-gateway) solution that makes managing users a breeze and even includes Github secret scanning.
&nbsp;  
##### Additionally, Zuplo supports several other auth systems like Auth0, Clerk, Supabase, and many more via policies. 
&nbsp;  
#### Rate Limiting and Throttling
&nbsp;  
##### API Gateways enforce rate limiting and throttling **to control the amount of traffic that backend services handle**.
&nbsp;  
##### Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a user can make within a specific timeframe, while throttling dynamically adjusts the rate of incoming requests based on current system load.
&nbsp;  
##### These mechanisms prevent abuse, ensure equitable resource use among consumers, and protect backend services from being overwhelmed, which could lead to degraded performance or outages.

&nbsp; 
##### These mechanisms prevent abuse, ensure equitable resource use among consumers, and protect backend services from being overwhelmed, which could lead to degraded performance or outages.
&nbsp; 
##### In Zuplo you have an availability to add rate limiting policy.
&nbsp; 
##### Let me show how to do that.
&nbsp; 
##### Within the already-seen Route Designer tab, you have the option of adding Policies. For Request, we can click on the **Add Policy button**, after which we get a popup with a bunch of policies that we can select.
&nbsp; 
##### We select Rate Limiting.
![Zuplo Rate Limiting](/images/blog/posts/api-gateways-the-secure-bridge-for-exposing-your-api/zuplo-rate-limiting.png)
&nbsp; 
##### This opens the JSON configuration where you can define your Rate Limiting Policy in detail.

&nbsp; 
##### Zuplo’s rate-limiting solution is highly flexible, and precise in globally distributed systems. Additionally, the platform automatically surfaces analytics on rate-limited users to you.
