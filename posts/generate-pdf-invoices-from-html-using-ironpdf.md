&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Background
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
##### Alright, letâ€™s talk invoices.
&nbsp;  

##### As someone who runs a developer brand, I often work with sponsors who want visibility across my newsletter, LinkedIn, and YouTube content. 
&nbsp;  

##### After we agree on a campaign - I need to send them a **clean, professional-looking PDF invoice**.
&nbsp;  

##### Sure, I could use Word or some billing software... but I wanted more control. I wanted automation. 
&nbsp;  

##### I wanted to plug this into my app, generate it with code, and style it with my own HTML/CSS.
&nbsp;  

##### Thatâ€™s where **IronPDF** came in - and honestly, it made the whole thing feel effortless.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### What is IronPDF?
&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

##### [IronPDF](https://ironpdf.com/) is a powerful .NET library that lets you generate PDFs from HTML, Razor views, or full URLs - using a real Chromium rendering engine.
&nbsp; 

##### Hereâ€™s what makes it different:
&nbsp; 

##### â€¢ You write HTML/CSS like normal - no need to learn a PDF-specific syntax
##### â€¢ It runs locally (no browser required)
##### â€¢ Outputs exactly what you'd see in Chrome
##### â€¢ Works in airgapped and secure environments (banks love it)
##### â€¢ Friendly API with minimal boilerplate
&nbsp; 
##### If youâ€™ve ever fought with low-fidelity PDF libraries that mess up your styles - IronPDF feels like a breath of fresh air.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### HTML to PDF Conversion With IronPDF
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### The first thing we are going to do is to add nuget package:

```csharp

Install-Package IronPdf
```
&nbsp;  

##### Letâ€™s define a C# class to represent an invoice:

```csharp

public class Invoice
{
    public string InvoiceNumber { get; set; }
    public string CompanyName { get; set; }
    public string ClientName { get; set; }
    public DateTime Date { get; set; } = DateTime.UtcNow;
    public List<(string Description, decimal Amount)> Items { get; set; }
    public decimal Total => Items.Sum(x => x.Amount);
}
```
&nbsp;  

##### This lets me dynamically create invoices for any client, with any line items (e.g. LinkedIn post, Newsletter ad).

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### The HTML Template
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### I created a basic HTML template and saved it in localhost as invoice.html file. You can use Razor view here, or even webpage from the url.

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        body { font-family: Arial; padding: 30px; }
        h1 { color: #444; }
        table { width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-top: 20px; }
        th, td { border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; text-align: left; }
        .total { text-align: right; font-weight: bold; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Invoice - </h1>
    <p><strong>Company:</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Client:</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> </p>

    <table>
        <thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>Amount</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody>
            
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p class="total">Total: $</p>
</body>
</html>
```
&nbsp;  
##### Here is the quick view on html page that's created with placeholders.

![Invoice Placeholder](/images/blog/posts/generate-pdf-invoices-from-html-using-ironpdf/invoice-placeholder.png)
&nbsp;  

##### Now in the code, I'm using the real data (already prepared from another API call) and I'm populating placeholders. 

```csharp

var invoice = new Invoice
{
    InvoiceNumber = "INV-2024-003",
    CompanyName = "TheCodeMan",
    ClientName = "FinTech Innovations Ltd",
    Items = new()
    {
        ("Newsletter Sponsorship", 500),
        ("LinkedIn Post", 300),
        ("Twitter Mention", 200)
    }
};

// Load HTML template
string htmlTemplate = File.ReadAllText("invoice.html");

// Convert line items to table rows
string itemsHtml = string.Join("", invoice.Items.Select(i =>
    $"<tr><td>{i.Description}</td><td>${i.Amount}</td></tr>"));

// Replace placeholders with real data
string filledHtml = htmlTemplate
    .Replace("", invoice.InvoiceNumber)
    .Replace("", invoice.CompanyName)
    .Replace("", invoice.ClientName)
    .Replace("", invoice.Date.ToShortDateString())
    .Replace("", itemsHtml)
    .Replace("", invoice.Total.ToString());
```
&nbsp;  
##### Finally I use IronPDF **ChromePdfRenderer** to convert the HTML to a PDF document.

```csharp

// Render to PDF
var renderer = new ChromePdfRenderer();
var pdf = renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf(filledHtml);
pdf.SaveAs("Invoice-FinTech.pdf");

Console.WriteLine("Invoice PDF generated!");
```
##### And that's all. So simple.
&nbsp;  
##### Here is the Pdf file as result:

##### **Licensing**
&nbsp;  

##### IronPDF is free for development use and has multiple pricing tiers for commercial use that you can check out [here](https://ironpdf.com/licensing/).
&nbsp;  

##### And now, I use Automation tool to send the email with this attachment. 

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Bonus: Digitally Sign the Invoice 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### Letâ€™s load the CSV and convert it to a list of products.

```csharp

var renderer = new ChromePdfRenderer();
var pdf = renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf(filledHtml);

var signature = new PdfSignature("certificate.pfx", "password")
{
    ContactInformation = "stefan@thecodeman.net",
    SigningReason = "Sponsorship Invoice",
    SigningLocation = "Nis, Serbia"
};

pdf.Sign(signature);

pdf.SaveAs("Invoice-FinTech.pdf");
```

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Some Advanced Things
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### There are also a few nice advanced tricks Iâ€™ve picked up. 
&nbsp;  

##### For instance, you can easily add your logo to the invoice by just embedding an **< img src="logo.png" />** tag right in the HTML - that way, your brand is front and center. 
&nbsp;  

##### If youâ€™re using Razor Views in an ASP .NET app, you can even render the invoice directly from your existing view templates using **RenderRazorViewToPdf()**. 
&nbsp;  

##### And if you prefer, you can skip the HTML string entirely and just point IronPDF to a live URL (like https://yourapp/invoice/123) using **RenderUrlAsPdf()**. 
&nbsp;  

##### Need headers or footers with page numbers, disclaimers, or payment terms? 
&nbsp;  

##### Just set **renderer.PrintOptions.Header** and **.Footer** to any HTML fragment you like. 
&nbsp;  

##### You can also bring in your own CSS files or bundle styles right into the document - making it easy to keep invoices visually consistent with your brand.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### How to merge 2 PDF files?
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### Another handy feature I use is PDF merging. 
&nbsp;  

##### Sometimes I want to include an additional document with the invoice - like a sponsorship agreement, campaign summary, or contract. 
&nbsp;  

##### With IronPDF, itâ€™s super easy to combine two (or more) PDFs into one. 
&nbsp;  

##### You just load both files using PdfDocument.FromFile(...) and merge them with PdfDocument.Merge(...). Then you save it as a single, polished PDF. 
&nbsp;  

##### This is especially useful when you're sending an invoice along with official paperwork - the client gets everything bundled neatly in one file, and you donâ€™t need to mess with external tools or manual merging.

```csharp

public void MergePdfs()
{
    var pdf1 = PdfDocument.FromFile("doc1.pdf");
    var pdf2 = PdfDocument.FromFile("doc2.pdf");
    var merged = PdfDocument.Merge(pdf1, pdf2);
    merged.SaveAs("merged.pdf");
}
```

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Wrapping Up
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

##### And thatâ€™s how I generate branded, professional invoices using IronPDF - all in C# and just a few lines of code.
&nbsp;  

##### Whether you're a solo dev sending invoices to clients, or you're working in a high-security environment like a bank or fintech company, IronPDF gives you the perfect mix of power, flexibility, and simplicity. 
&nbsp;  

##### You write HTML like you normally would, and IronPDF handles the rest - from styling and logos to digital signatures and PDF merging.
&nbsp;  

##### Itâ€™s not just a tool I tested - itâ€™s something I actually use every time I need to bill a sponsor. 
&nbsp;  

##### And once you set it up, it feels like magic. One click, and a beautifully rendered invoice is ready to send.
