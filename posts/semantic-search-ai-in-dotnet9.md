&nbsp; &nbsp; 
### What Is Semantic Search in AI?
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp;
##### Semantic search goes beyond traditional keyword matching. 
&nbsp;
##### Instead of merely looking for literal text, it uses deep learning models to understand the meaning behind a user's query and the content of documents. Hereâ€™s how it works:
&nbsp;
##### **â€¢ Embeddings:** Text is converted into high-dimensional numerical vectors (embeddings) that capture the semantic essence of words, sentences, or documents.
##### **â€¢ Similarity Metrics:** Using measures like cosine similarity, these vectors are compared. The closer two vectors are, the more semantically similar the texts are.
##### **â€¢ Improved Relevance: ** This method allows for finding results that match the intent and context of the query, even if the exact keywords arenâ€™t present.
&nbsp;

##### In the context of AI, semantic search has been widely used for tasks like document retrieval, recommendation systems, and conversational search applications.

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
### Semantic Search in .NET with Microsoft.Extensions.AI
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 

##### In the .NET ecosystem, developers can harness semantic search techniques by using libraries that simplify the integration of AI capabilities. 
&nbsp; 

##### One such library is **Microsoft.Extensions.AI**.
&nbsp; 

##### What Is Microsoft.Extensions.AI?
&nbsp; 

##### Itâ€™s a set of extensions designed to integrate AI services into .NET applications. The library provides abstractions and interfaces (like IEmbeddingGenerator) that let you easily connect to AI endpoints or models.
&nbsp; 

##### With these abstractions, you can generate embeddings from text, which is a fundamental step in implementing semantic search. This makes it much easier to build applications that require understanding and comparing text semantically.
&nbsp; 

##### By using Microsoft.Extensions.AI, developers can avoid writing low-level code to interact with AI models, thereby accelerating development and focusing on business logic.
&nbsp; 

##### Let's see how to implement it.

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
### Semantic Search Implmentation - Real Example
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 

##### You know I have a blog on my website. Let's say I want to implement Search functionality via .NET. 
&nbsp; 

##### The requirement is that I can enter anything in the search field and that they extract the 3 best-ranked articles from the mass of blog posts that match the query I'm looking for.
&nbsp; 

##### For the simplicity of the example, I will not use the complete content of each article, but only the titles - it is absolutely identical.
&nbsp; 

##### First, it is necessary to extract the data, ie. blog post titles. We'll put that in a list of strings. 

```csharp

var blogPostTitles = new[]
{
    "Debug and Test Multi-Environment Postgres Db in .NET with Aspire + Neon",

    "Compile-time logging source generation for highly performant logging"
};
```
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
###  Initializing the Embedding Generator
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
 
##### An embedding generator is like a translator that converts words or sentences into numbers. These numbers, arranged in a list (or vector), capture the meaning of the text. 
&nbsp; 
##### This way, computers can compare texts by looking at their numerical representations and easily figure out which texts are similar or related.

```csharp

IEmbeddingGenerator<string, Embedding<float>> embeddingGenerator =
    new OllamaEmbeddingGenerator(new Uri("http://127.0.0.1:11434"), modelId: "all-minilm");
```

##### â€¢ IEmbeddingGenerator Interface: Defines the contract for generating embeddings from a string input.
&nbsp; 

##### â€¢ OllamaEmbeddingGenerator: A concrete implementation that connects to an AI endpoint (in this case, running locally at http://127.0.0.1:11434) and uses a specific model (all-minilm) to generate embeddings.
&nbsp; 

##### â€¢ Purpose: This generator transforms any input text into a numerical vector that captures its semantic meaning.
&nbsp; 

##### Note: You need to download [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) as well as ["all-minilm" language model](https://ollama.com/library/all-minilm). 

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
### 4. Generating Embeddings for Blog Posts
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 

```csharp

Console.WriteLine("Generating embeddings for blog post titles...");
var candidateEmbeddings = await embeddingGenerator.GenerateAndZipAsync(blogPostTitles);
Console.WriteLine("Embeddings generated successfully.");
```
&nbsp; 

##### **GenerateAndZipAsync**: This asynchronous method processes all candidate texts, generates their embeddings, and bundles (or "zips") them together for efficient access.
&nbsp; 
##### **Outcome**: Each blog post title now has an associated embedding that represents its semantic content.

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
### Interactive Query Processing - Semantic Search
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 

```csharp

while (true)
{
    Console.WriteLine("\nEnter your query (or press Enter to exit):");
    var userInput = Console.ReadLine();

    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(userInput))
    {
        break;
    }

    // Generate embedding for the user's input.
    var userEmbedding = await embeddingGenerator.GenerateEmbeddingAsync(userInput);
}
```
&nbsp; 
##### **User Input:** The program prompts the user to enter a query. If the input is empty, the loop ends.
&nbsp; 
##### **Embedding Generation:** For each query, an embedding is generated so that it can be compared with the candidate embeddings.

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 
### Computing Similarity and Retrieving Top Matches
&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 

```csharp

  // Compute cosine similarities and get the top three matches.
    var topMatches = candidateEmbeddings
        .Select(candidate => new
        {
            Text = candidate.Value,
            Similarity = TensorPrimitives.CosineSimilarity(
                candidate.Embedding.Vector.Span, userEmbedding.Vector.Span)
        })
        .OrderByDescending(match => match.Similarity)
        .Take(3);

    Console.WriteLine("\nTop matching blog post titles:");
    foreach (var match in topMatches)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Similarity: {match.Similarity:F4} - {match.Text}");
    }
```
&nbsp; 
##### **Cosine Similarity Calculation:** For every candidate (title), the code computes how similar its embedding is to the userâ€™s query embedding using cosine similarity. A higher score means more semantic similarity.
&nbsp; 

##### **Selecting Top Matches:** The candidates are sorted in descending order based on their similarity scores, and the top three are selected.
&nbsp; 

##### **Displaying Results:** The program then outputs the most semantically similar blog post titles along with their similarity scores.
&nbsp; 

##### TensorPrimitives is part of System.Numerics.Tensors. It provides types and methods for tensor operations. Tensors are essential for representing embeddings as high-dimensional vectors.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Wrapping Up
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

##### This code snippet is a practical example of how semantic search can be implemented in a .NET application using Microsoft.Extensions.AI. 
&nbsp;
##### By converting both the candidate texts and user queries into embeddings and comparing them via cosine similarity, the system can deliver search results that truly match the userâ€™s intent.
&nbsp;

##### Feel free to use and adapt this explanation and code breakdown for your blog post to help readers understand the power of semantic search and how to leverage AI within the .NET ecosystem.
