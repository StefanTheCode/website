                    <h5>
                        SOLID is an acronym for a set of <b> 5 design principles</b> that help improve the
                        maintainability, scalability, and stability of software systems. These principles were
                        introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming.
                    </h5> <br>
                    <h5>
                        It is essentially a way for two different applications to communicate with each other in "real
                        time" rather than relying on periodic polling or manual data transfer.
                    </h5> <br>
                    <h5>
                        Here's a brief explanation of each principle:
                    </h5> <br>
                    <h5>
                        <b>1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</b>: A class should have only one reason to change,
                        meaning it should have only one responsibility. This principle helps to achieve separation of
                        concerns. (not completely true by today).
                    </h5> <br>
                    <h5>
                        <b>2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</b>: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
                    </h5> <br>
                    <h5>
                        <b>3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</b>: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program. 
                            This principle ensures that derived classes can be used as their base class without any issues.
                    </h5> <br>
                    <h5>
                        <b>4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</b>: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. 
                            This principle helps to reduce the number of unimplemented or unnecessary methods in a class.
                    </h5> <br>
                    <h5>
                        <b>5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</b>: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). 
                            This principle helps to decouple software components, making the system more maintainable, flexible, and easier to test.
                    </h5> <br>
                    <h3 class="text-center mb-5 mt-5" style="color: #ffbd39;margin-top: -40px;">Single Responsibility Principle</h3>
                    <h5>People frequently misinterpret and misquote the idea that "a class or function should only have one responsibility." Although this guidance is beneficial, it does not precisely align with the Single Responsibility Principle.</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>What actually means?</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>The reason to change isn’t a technical one implied by the ‘Do One Thing’ rule, where the reason might be that a different framework is being used, or errors need to be logged in a different format. The reason to change here is that a real-world process has changed or needs to change, and the code needs to reflect that. </h5>
                    <h5>Different departments or teams within an organization often use distinct jargon and have unique perspectives on their processes. </h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>For instance, in a company that sells books, the way employees in a physical store discuss a book may differ significantly from how those in the warehouse or sales and purchasing teams discuss it.</h5>
                    <h5>It is possible to have two distinct versions of a class named Book, each designed for a particular department or process with the required properties. Both versions would include an ISBN for possible system connectivity. If modifications were made to the Book class utilized by the sales department, they would not affect the software in the warehouse since it uses its own implementation of the Book class specific to its Bounded Context.</h5>

                    <h3 class="text-center mb-5" style="color: #ffbd39">Open-Closed Principle</h3>
                    <h5>It was introduced by Bertrand Meyer in 1988.</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you should be able to add new functionality or modify the behavior of a module without altering its existing code.</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>By adhering to the Open/Closed Principle, you can create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software. When changes are required, new code can be added through inheritance or by implementing interfaces, rather than modifying existing code, which can introduce new bugs or break existing functionality. </h5>
                    <h5>A common approach to achieve OCP in object-oriented languages like C# is to use interfaces and polymorphism. Here's a simple example:</h5>
                    
                    <img src="/images/blog/newsletter11/2.png"

                    <h3 class="text-center mb-5" style="color: #ffbd39">Liskov Substitusion Principle</h3>
                    <h5>It was introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987.</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>The principle states that objects of a derived class (subclass) should be able to replace objects of the base class (superclass) without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes.</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>LSP is a stronger form of the "is-a" relationship between a derived class and its base class. It ensures that a derived class does not violate any of the contracts or expectations of the base class, such as the method signatures, return types, input parameter types, and behavior. </h5>
                    <h5>By adhering to the Liskov Substitution Principle, you can create more maintainable, flexible, and robust software systems. It reduces the risk of introducing bugs when using inheritance and polymorphism.</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Here's an example to demonstrate the Liskov Substitution Principle in C#:</h5>

                    <h5>The Bird class does not have a Fly method, and we've introduced an IFly interface for birds that can fly. This updated design satisfies the Liskov Substitution Principle and better represents the relationship between different bird types and their abilities.
                    </h5><br>
                    <h3 class="text-center mb-5" style="color: #ffbd39">Interface Segregation Principle</h3>
                    <h5>The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that many smaller, focused interfaces are better than one large, general-purpose interface. By following this principle, you can avoid forcing a class to implement methods it doesn't need or use, which makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand.</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Here's an example in C# to demonstrate the Interface Segregation Principle:</h5>

                    <img src="/images/blog/newsletter11/4.png"
                        style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 100%;">
                    <h5>
                        Now we can create specific worker classes that implement only the interfaces they need:
                    </h5>
                    <img src="/images/blog/newsletter11/5.png"
                    style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 100%;">
                    <h5>By applying the Interface Segregation Principle, we now have more focused interfaces and classes that implement only the methods they actually need. This makes the code more maintainable, easier to understand, and less prone to errors.
                    </h5><br>
                    <h3 class="text-center mb-5" style="color: #ffbd39">Dependency Inversion Principle</h3>
                    <h5>The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). This principle helps to decouple software components, making the system more maintainable, flexible, and easier to test.</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Here's an example in C# to demonstrate the Dependency Inversion Principle:</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Suppose we have an application that sends notifications via email. A naïve approach might create a NotificationSender class that directly depends on a specific implementation of an EmailSender class.</h5>
                    <h5>In this design, the NotificationSender class directly depends on the EmailSender class, which makes it difficult to change or test different methods of sending notifications.</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>To follow the Dependency Inversion Principle, we should create an interface for the notification sender and have both the high-level and low-level modules depend on this abstraction:</h5>

                    <img src="/images/blog/newsletter11/6.png"
                        style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; width: 100%;">
                    <h5>
                        Now the NotificationService class depends on the INotificationSender interface, which decouples it from the specific implementation of the EmailSender class.
This makes it easier to switch to a different notification sending method or to mock the notification sender for testing purposes.
                    </h5><br>

                    <h5>The Bird class does not have a Fly method, and we've introduced an IFly interface for birds that can fly. This updated design satisfies the Liskov Substitution Principle and better represents the relationship between different bird types and their abilities.
